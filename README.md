# Neovim configuration

> This is my vimrc. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Consists mostly of generic UI/UX and LSP stuff, nothing particularly fancy.

If you want to try it out:

- Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html)
- Run `nix-shell https://github.com/QuentinI/nvim/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz --command nvim`
- (Or `nix run github:QuentinI/nvim` if you have flakes enabled, which you should)

Best viewed in itself (you will get syntax highlighting for vimscript/lua embeds).

There are some comments here and there, but this doesn't aim to be a distribution of Neovim. It's my personal config first and foremost, though one could probably use it as a reference or a starting point.
